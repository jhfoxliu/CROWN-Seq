# CROWN-Seq

**C**onversion **R**esistance detection **O**n **W**hole-transcriptomic **N6**,2â€²-O-dimethyladenosine transcription-start sites by **Seq**uencing, is a single base resolution m6Am detection and quantification method developed by Jianheng Liu (Fox) @ Jaffrey Lab. By this method, one can profile the m6Am stoichiometry at single transcription-start nucleotide level. This Github Repo is for the computational pipeline for CROWN-Seq.

## How to

The CROWN-Seq pipeline consists of two parts:

1. Obtain accurate transcription-start sites by ReCappable-Seq or CROWN-Seq. (see `denovo` folder)
2. Measure the m6Am levels. (see `m6Am_call` folder)

Scripts for metadata generation are under `scripts` folder.

You may follow the notebooks to reproduce the results.
